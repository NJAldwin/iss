Usage
=====
Since it is written in python, it is simple to run the program as follows:

    python iss.py <input>

Where `<input>` is the filename of the binary program.

Notes
=====
Our software relies on the Python standard library

With Professor Fei's approval, we intended to combine parts 2 and 3 of the project, rendering this into a "status" update for Professor Fei.  In doing so, we have already resolved the HLT control hazard, and have begun adding forwarding.

At present, we have completed the pipelining stage and are presently working through data hazards.
