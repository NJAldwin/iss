Usage
=====
Since it is written in python, it is simple to run the program as follows:

    python iss.py <input>

Where `<input>` is the filename of the binary program.

Notes
=====
Our software relies on the Python standard library.

To debug the program (or for a detailed progression of data flowing through
the pipeline), set the value of the variable _DEBUG_ to _True_ on line 30.

To debug the program step-by-step (`[return]` between each cycle), set the value
of _STEP_ to _True_ on line 34 (while in _DEBUG_ mode). 

Please view _report.md_ for more detailed information on our project.
